You may choose any state in the United States to find out about the statistics regarding honey production from 1998- 2012. 
From the bottom left corner, we can see from the color gradient that the most expensive prices per pound of honey are sold by NV, 
SC, TN, IL, and KY. Once we highlight these countries, we can see that there are average total production and yield per colony for these states; 
however, IL has the greatest yield per colony of 61.67. At the same time, CA has $9680700 worth of stocks and ranks #1 in stock value. 
The stocks for IL was at $3149000, sfollowed by NC ($189800). 
It seemed as if there is a direct relationship between average total production of honey and the stock prices of the state. 
Also, the countries with the highest price per pound were located in exactly the same latitude and almost next to the sea 
(either the Pacific Ocean or the Atlantic ocean).
